# Human Temperature

Examining human body temperature using inferential statistics. The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 C or 98.6 F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. This project analyzes a dataset of human body temperatures and employs the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.
