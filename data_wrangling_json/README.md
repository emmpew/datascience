# Data Wrangling

Data sources can vary from unstructured or semi-structured text files (.txt) and delimited, structured or nested format files (excel, csv, json, xml). While working with data stored in files, the basic operation is to read files into a Pandas data frame. Most of the formats have standard row and column tables, and are relatively easy to work with. JSON and XML are nested formats and need some more work.

### Key Terms & Concepts

- **Raw data:** data from original or secondary sources that may be unstructured or corrupted and needs more work performed on it before it can be analyzed.
- **Data wrangling:**  process of taking data in its ‘raw’ form and manipulating it in various ways into a ‘useful’ form.
- **‘Messy’ or ‘Dirty’ data:**  data can be ‘messy’ or ‘dirty’ in the sense that it might contain values that are invalid, missing, corrupted, inconsistent or non-uniform.
