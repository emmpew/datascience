# Proposal

**Title:** Predicting the duration of a taxi trip in NYC

**Problem:** If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request and maximize their revenue. It is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have the taxi occupied to improve the efficiency of dispatching systems.

**Who might care?** Big companies like Uber, Lyft, Taxify, Didi Chuxing, and other peer-to-peer ride sharing companies can use such a model to predict the duration of a taxi trip in major cities. They can make better estimates of how much to charge per ride as well as better predictions on the duration of the ride. From the customer's point of view, the price paid per ride could decrease with the improvement and optimization of a driver's traveling time improving customer satisfaction. 

**Data:** The data with the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City will be acquired from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com). The dataset includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables. It contains data collected for the year 2016 from two different vendors. 

**Approach:** Since the goal is to predict the duration of a taxi trip with labeled data, a supervised regression algorithm is a good fit for the model.

**Deliverables:**

1. Code: loading data, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning algorithms.
2. Report on the project
